# NinjaTrader Indicators

This repository contains a collection of custom indicators developed for the NinjaTrader 8.

## Indicators Included

1. **Exponential ATR**
   - Calculates the Average True Range (ATR) using an exponential moving average formula.

2. **MACD Histogram**
    - A MACD Histogram (only histogram) with up and down colors. It's helpful for who uses histogram only as a momentum indicator.

3. **Volume with EMA**
   - Combines a volume histogram with an EMA of volume, coloring bars based on whether the volume is above or below the EMA.

4. **Renko with Wicks**
   - A Renko bar type based on the original renko but including the wick information. You need to include and use both the bar type and chart style.

5. **Ergonomic Charts**
   - Enhances chart navigation by allowing free panning (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally) without holding the Ctrl key and enables zooming with the scroll wheel. NOTICE that this indicator works simulating Ctrl key click and hold, which could lead to some glitches and conflicts with hotkeys.
